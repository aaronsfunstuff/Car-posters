# Car Poster Gallery

This project is a 3D Car Poster Gallery created using JavaScript and A-Frame. The gallery showcases a collection of car posters in a visually engaging 3D environment. Users can navigate through the gallery and view each car poster in detail.

## Features
- **3D Environment:** The gallery is built in a 3D space using A-Frame, providing an immersive experience.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can navigate through the gallery using arrow keys or by clicking on navigation buttons.
- **High-Quality Posters:** Each poster is a high-resolution image of a car, displayed on 3D planes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** For styling the gallery.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and logic.
- **A-Frame:** For creating the 3D environment.

## How Each Poster Was Created
1. **Poster Design:**
   - Each car poster was designed using graphic design software (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator).
   - The design process involved selecting high-quality images of cars, enhancing them, and adding text or other graphic elements.
   - The final posters were exported as high-resolution JPEG or PNG files.

2. **Integration into A-Frame:**
   - Each poster image was added to the `assets` section of the A-Frame scene.
   - The posters were then mapped onto 3D planes using A-Frame's `<a-image>` component.
